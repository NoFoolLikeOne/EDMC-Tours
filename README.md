# EDMC-Tours
A Repository of Elite Dangerous Tours for EDMC-Tour Manager.

EDMC-Tour-Manager is an ED Market Connector Plugin that presents users of EDMC with the location of the nearest system in one or more tours that are downloaded from this repository

EDMC-Tour-Manager will download the master list from the repository and will download the tours listed in it.

Each tour will have a brief description and a list of systems and bodies.

The repository of tours will be open source to enourage people to create their own and build up the list of offical tours.

# Process

1. Create a branch and add your tour to the master list. 
2. Create a tour file 
3. Create a pull request
4. Your tour will be evaluated and merged into the master list.

# Testing your tour

EDMC-Tour-Manager will allow you to store a tour locally for testing. See EDMC-Tour-Manager for details
